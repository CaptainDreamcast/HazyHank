# Hazy Hank for Dreamcast

Small platformer for Sega Dreamcast. Jump with A, move with directional buttons or analog stick. Jump on enemies to kill them (or just avoid them) and make your way to the goal.

Warning: Do not play if you are prone to seasickness and/or have a weak stomach. Seriously.

Burnable CDI will be available once I find where exactly my Discjuggler went during those last four years.
